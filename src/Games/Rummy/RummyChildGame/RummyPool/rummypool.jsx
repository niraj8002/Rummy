          Pool Rummy is a popular variation of the classic 13-card Indian Rummy, designed for players who enjoy longer, strategic gameplay. Unlike Points Rummy, Pool Rummy is played over multiple rounds until a player reaches the maximum point limit and gets eliminated. The last player remaining in the pool wins the game.

              The History and Evolution of Rummy
            </h3>

              Why Rummy is a Game of Skill?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
            Rummy is legally classified as a game of skill in many countries. Players must make thoughtful decisions, track discarded cards, use jokers wisely, and adapt strategies in real-time. The outcome is determined by mental sharpness and planning — not chance.

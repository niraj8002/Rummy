           Deal Rummy is a thrilling variation of the classic Rummy game, where a fixed number of deals are played, and each player is given a pre-decided number of chips at the beginning. At the end of all the deals, the player with the highest number of chips wins. It’s a fast-paced, chip-based version that adds a competitive edge to the traditional gameplay.

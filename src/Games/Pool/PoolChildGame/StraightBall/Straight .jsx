            Introduction
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Straight Pool, also known as 14.1 Continuous, is a classic cue sport
            loved for its strategy, precision, and scoring potential. Unlike
            8-ball or 9-ball, players can pocket any ball on the table, with
            each successful shot earning one point. The goal is to reach a
            predetermined score—typically 100 or 150—before your opponent. It's
            a game of endurance, focus, and consistent accuracy, ideal for
            players who enjoy tactical depth and long runs.

              Skill Required to Master Straight Pool
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
              Straight Pool demands a high level of cue control, shot planning,
              and patience. To excel, players must develop: Positional
              Awareness: Carefully manage cue ball placement for the next shot.
              Pattern Recognition: Identify the best sequence to clear the rack
              efficiently. Break Shot Technique: Master the end-of-rack break to
              keep your run going. Mental Stamina: Stay focused across long,
              uninterrupted turns. Precision Shooting: Minimize errors to
              maintain control and momentum. This format rewards disciplined,
              thoughtful players who thrive under pressure.

              Winning Strategies for Straight Pool
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
              Success in Straight Pool is about more than just potting
              balls—it's about maintaining a run: Plan 3–5 Shots Ahead: Think
              beyond the current ball to keep position. Master the Break Shot: A
              controlled break of the racked balls after 14 are cleared is
              critical. Minimize Risks: Don’t go for low-percentage shots unless
              absolutely necessary. Keep the Cue Ball in the Center Table:
              Offers more positional options for the next shot. Practice
              Defensive Play: When runs aren't possible, leave tough positions
              for your opponent. The game is won by outthinking and
              outmaneuvering, not just outshooting.

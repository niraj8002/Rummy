            What is Poker?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Poker is a globally popular card game that blends psychology,
            probability, and strategy. Players place bets based on the strength
            of their hand, aiming to either have the best five-card combination
            or bluff their way to victory. With various betting rounds, dynamic
            gameplay, and endless strategy, poker offers a high-stakes thrill
            whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned pro.

              How to play poker?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
              Poker games follow a general flow, especially in popular formats
              like Texas Hold’em or Pot-Limit Omaha (PLO): <br /> 1. The Deal
              Each player receives a set of hole cards (private cards).
              Community cards are dealt face-up in the center of the table
              across several betting rounds.
              <br /> 2. The Betting Rounds Players place bets in four rounds:
              pre-flop, flop, turn, and river. You can fold, call, raise, or
              check depending on your hand and strategy.
              <br /> 3. The Showdown After the final betting round, if more than
              one player remains, all active players reveal their hands. The
              player with the best hand (based on poker hand rankings) wins the
              pot.

              Why Poker is a Game of Skill ?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
              Contrary to popular belief, poker is not purely about luck.
              Successful players rely on a combination of-
              <br />
              Mathematical calculations (pot odds, hand probabilities)
              <br />
              Game theory strategy
              <br />
              Reading opponents’ behavior
              <br />
              Emotional control and discipline
              <br />
              In the long run, consistent winners are those who study, adapt,
              and execute advanced strategies — making poker a recognized game
              of skill.

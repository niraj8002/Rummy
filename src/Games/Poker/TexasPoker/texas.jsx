            What is Texas Hold’em?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Texas Hold’em is the most popular variant of poker played
            worldwide—from online platforms to global tournaments. Each player
            receives two private hole cards, and five community cards are dealt
            face-up on the table. The goal is to make the best five-card hand
            using any combination of your hole cards and the community cards.
            Its perfect blend of strategy, skill, and psychology makes it the
            gold standard of poker.

            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
              Winning at Texas Hold’em isn’t just about the cards you hold. It’s
              about reading opponents, calculating odds, knowing when to fold or
              go all-in, and managing your chip stack. Success depends on
              critical thinking, emotional control, and long-term strategy
              rather than short-term luck.

              Winning Strategies for Texas Hold’em
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
              Play selectively: Don’t chase every hand. Focus on starting hand
              strength.
              <br />
              Position matters: Act later in the betting round to gain more
              information.
              <br />
              Bluff wisely: A well-timed bluff can win big pots, but overuse can
              be costly.
              <br />
              Read opponents: Pay attention to betting patterns, timing, and
              behavior.
              <br />
              Bankroll discipline: Stick to limits you can afford and play the
              long game.
